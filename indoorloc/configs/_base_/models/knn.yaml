# KNN Localizer Configuration
# Traditional k-Nearest Neighbors for indoor localization

model:
  type: KNNLocalizer

  # Number of neighbors to consider
  # Larger k = smoother predictions, smaller k = more local
  k: 5

  # Weight function: 'uniform' or 'distance'
  # 'distance': closer neighbors have more influence
  weights: distance

  # Distance metric: 'euclidean', 'manhattan', 'minkowski'
  metric: euclidean

  # Algorithm: 'auto', 'ball_tree', 'kd_tree', 'brute'
  # 'auto' selects best based on data
  algorithm: auto

  # Whether to predict floor and building
  predict_floor: true
  predict_building: true
